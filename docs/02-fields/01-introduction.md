# Introduction

Fields are configurable (custom) Filament form fields that can be used in Forms and Settings. We provide a set of fields that can be used out of the box, but you can also create your own fields.

![field-example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vormkracht10/backstage/refs/heads/feature/implement-fileuploadcare-with-mediapicker/docs/02-fields/field-example.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAAC2JCGC3R52FKRKS5LQOFFHEZ3L4WMQ)

Most of the fields are based on the Filament fields, but we might miss some configuration options. If you need a specific configuration option, you can create your own field or submit a PR to add the configuration option to the field.

## Setup

If you want to have your custom fields available in backstage, register them by adding the fields to `config/backstage.php`.

```php
return [
    // ...

    'fields' => [

    ]
];
```

Then this component should be available in the Settings field relation manager:
