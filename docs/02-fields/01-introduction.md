## Overview

Fields are configurable (custom) Filament form fields that can be used in Forms and Settings.

## Setup

Next, if you wanna have this component available in backstage, register them by adding the component to `config/backstage.php`.

```php
return [
    // ...

    'fields' => [

    ]
];
```

Then this component should be available in Backstage. You should add the required fields to the block.
